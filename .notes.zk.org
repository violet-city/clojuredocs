Let's see if we can declaratively define our endpoints:

+ routing -- server & client
+ db querying -- server
+ input coercion / transformation -- server
+ validation -- server & client
+ data querying / storage -- server
+ error handling -- server & client
  + failed validations
    + 422 :general-error, :prop-errors
+ response transformation -- server
+ authorizaton -- server

+ Server
  + routing
  + db querying
  + db storage
  + validation
  + error handling
  + response transformation
  + authorization

+ Client
  + routing
  + validation
  + failed validation reporting


It would be nice if both the client call functions and endpoint
generation could be done off of the same data.

Single-field validation, form submit -> routing -> input coercion

(client-call schema context success error)

It's unfortunate that you have to visit 3 different namespaces to add
a single endpoint, this needs to be fixed. Part of the reason right
now is that the schema is cross-platform and the endpoints are
not. Another part is that you have to explicitly mount endpoints in
`clojuredocs.server`. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj0gfSRLm0

All this is fixable I think.

Actually four places, also the front-end code that uses that
endpoint.

** Layout

+ clojuredocs.api.schemas -- schemas, cross env
+ clojuredocs.api.server (clj)
+ clojuredocs.api.client (cljs)

(api/request api/get-examples
  payload
  on-success
  on-error)

(api/response api/get-examples handler)

(server/endpoint get-examples handler)

+clj
(defn get-examples [r])

+cljs
(defn get-examples [opts success error]




* App Layout

** Clj
+ Config
+ Init
+ Client API
+ Page Rendering
+ Comps
+ Data Access

** Cljs
+ Server Comm
+ Widgets
+ Cross components
+ Routing?


** pages.clj / pages subdir

Used to house all page rendering logic. Adding a page? The route /
logic should probably go in pages.clj. If the logic for rendering your
page needs a bunch of supporting functions, or if there are many pages
that should all be grouped logically, consider adding a namespace to
the pages subdir (see search feedback routes, for example). Routes
should only be added to pages.clj unless you really, really need to
handle routing in your namespace.


* Examples / Example History

+ Use Cases
  + View example -- Show author / editors in example meta, and latest
    edit body and last updated timestamp


* User Accounts

ClojureDocs v1 used OpenID, which is being phased out pretty much
anywhere (oh well). So we've got a bunch of user accounts from the old
version of CD that have to be migrated over.

Personally, I don't really want to maintain a user identity that's
specific to ClojureDocs. I like the idea of using GitHub auth (oauth2)
initially and adding on other providers. Just have to handle the case
of login collisions from different providers.



* Coupling In Widgets

+ Styleguide is a good stage for isolation
+ Widgets should work both in context and in isolation
+ Using channels to isolate widgets
+ How does this work with nested widgets?

Is an appropriate shape of a widget the:
+ state
+ no external calls
+ state is not modified in-widget?

That last one is interesting, lets visit that. Another way to state
that question is: should all app state modification be done out of
widget?

Probably not, error handling becomes to arduous. So then isolation
becomes a matter of configuration.

+ Should be able to put the widget in any of it's states in a
  straightforward way (passing data). Channels hurt here.
+ Composibility of widgets is important, channels add another
  dimension when thinking about composibility.
+ Right now state transitions are hard to follow, alot of it is
  spread across the namespace. What's the cause of that?
+ Should event handlers just be about putting stuff onto a queue?
+ Maybe localizing all mutation to the widget itself isn't a bad idea,
  as opposed to channels escaping the widget. This begs the question
  of how inter-widget communication should work (refs?).

Results are looking good so far, essentially all state manipulation
happens in the same place, which is a good thing. There's still the
question as to whether this could be accomplished by just moving code
around. Even if not, is it worth the overhad managing channels?


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

(defn event-loop [state text-chan cancel-chan]
  (go
    (loop []
      (prn @state)
      (let [[v ch] (async/alts! [text-chan cancel-chan] :priority)]
        (condp = ch
          text-chan (do
                      (swap! state assoc :text v)
                      (recur))
          cancel-chan (prn "CANCEL"))))))

(let [t (async/chan 10)
      c (async/chan 10)]
  (event-loop (atom) t c)
  (go
    (>! t "foo")
    (<! (timeout 100))
    (>! t "bar"))
  #_(go
    (>! c "hello")
    (<! (timeout 100))
    (>! c "world")
    (<! (timeout 1000))
    (>! c "the quick")))

#+END_SRC

It really seems like overkill instead of manipulating state directly
in the event handler, but let's try it.

Ok, hit a road block. An example doesn't know how to remove itself
from the page, so there needs to be some communication outside that
handles this.

Two problems:

1. How is this communication structured? A channel that the widge
   exposes? A channel that is passed to the widget to put deletes on?
   An event that's fired? The widget is passed the shared structure
   and it removes the example from the list of examples? A flag on
   the example that prevents it from being rendered?
   + If it's a channel passed into the widget, how is that passed
     through multiple layers of widgets, if multiple layers exist?
2. How to identify the example to be removed?


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

(defn wire-meta-behavior [owner example report-delete-chan]
  (let [delete-ch (chan)]
    (go-loop []
      (when-let [delete-state (<! delete-ch)]
        (condp = delete-state
          :do-delete
          (let [res (<! (delete-example example))]
            (if (= 200 (:status res))
              (!> report-delete-chan example)
              (om/set-state! owner :delete-state :error)))
          (om/set-state! owner :delete-state delete-state))
        (recur)))
    {:delete-ch delete-ch}))

#+END_SRC

I'm not a huge fan of how the event handlers are bound by specifying
the function to run in the element attributes.

Ok, it's a little better, but still coupled. I've been thinking about
having a single channel / pair of channels be the communication
interface to a widget, and how state is manipulated, so information
flows:

app state -> events -> channels -> app state

Server comm should probably be done at the top level, or as high-up
as possible


* Localizing state, communication, and UI

Widgets interact with state either through putting messages on
provided channels, or manipulating the state they have in scope (cursors).

component / page / container / world / widget / loop / link / module
/ mod

Mod -- app state

Removed syntax highlighter in favor of the one cribbed from
Reagent. Feels way more performant, and I can remove
syntaxhighlighter & supporting files from the frontend.

458K pre, 433K post :D


<2014-09-19 Fri 16:40>

Feels like I'm getting close. The to do list is down to about 5
items, but I'm sure I'll add more before launch. Got the DNS servers
switched over from 1and1 to Route 53. I really need to get that
domain reg switched over to namecheap. 1and1 is such a POS.

Copy is the next big thing, I'll do on or two passes, but there are
much better writers in the community that can help out.

Post-launch: autocomplete is way, way to slow. Was getting ~1-2
seconds turn-around on my mobile tether, prob get around 250ms on
cable. That's still to slow I think, we need to try shiping all the vars
down and do the search on the client next. It's not that much, ~1000
vars clocks in around:

1000 vars * (50B name + 200B docstring + 100B fudge) = 350K extras

Less w/ gzip

I'm guessing that extra 350K is worth it if cachable.


* <2014-09-21 Sun 00:22>

Getting close to a release, just need to get some help banging on the
thing. Also working on persisting search state:

https://github.com/zk/clojuredocs/issues/68

There's a ton of stuff once you dig in.

+ back / forward through queries
+ restoring state on back
+ store autocomplete results in local storage to be able to instantly
  populate on back nav

The search stuff needs a good refactor anyway, the separation of
concerns and encapsulaton is poor


* <2016-08-13 Sat 17:08>

Getting everything updated to 1.8, which was released months ago. You
know, 1.9 alpha 10 is out, I should update to that while I'm at it.

Also I've just noticed that the delete example link isn't working.

Add / update works.

Delete on see-alsos work. Delete on notes work.

I should compile for prod locally to double check on this release.


* <2016-08-20 Sat 16:46>

Added display of the current clojure version to the homepage for
desktop / mobile. Really love the mobile slide-out menu, that thing
has really held up over time.

Continuing the reagent transition. Still in the middle of the yak
shave to get the app lifecycle stuff implemented -- js reloading (that
reminds me I need to convert the less over to garden, and to do that I
need to get reup in).

I'm a little burned out on getting examples moved over, so let me get
reup in.

+ Mongo connection shutdown in main/start / stop
+ Switch start to passing through stop function

Sometimes when you have to restart the server it's a huge PITA because
you can't get the repl back up until you fix the errors. This causes
your eval cycle time to jump to 10s of seconds.


* <2016-10-22 Sat 19:33>

Yup, had to do 7/8 edits to fix the problem, ran into a side case
where generated cljs (and cljc) files were referencing a removed
library (sablono). Why this was reported through the reup.clj path I
have no idea. Tests maybe? nsfw.reup/setup?

Something's been bugging me about the ops/kit stuff. It's really nice
to be able to not think about the state transitions, to handle sync
and async updates well, to handle context well. But something bugs me
about the way you do updates:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

  (defn handle-update-example [state {:keys [text _id]}]
    (let [ch (chan)]
      (go
        (put! ch (-> state
                     (update-example _id
                       merge
                       {:loading? true})))
        (let [res (<! (req-update-example _id text))]
          (put! ch
            (fn [state]
              (if (:success res)
                (update-example
                  state
                  _id
                  merge
                  (:data res)
                  {:loading? false :editing? false})

                (update-example
                  state
                  _id
                  merge
                  {:error (:message res)
                   :loading? false})))))
        (close! ch))
      ch))

#+END_SRC

Maybe I don't know enough about core.async, but the puts seem
redundant. Shouldn't whatever the last statement evaluates to be put
on the channel the go block returns? Do go blocks return channels, or
did I make that up?

The larger issue is that my lack of understanding means I'm possibly
missing or misusing some of the functionality that solves some of the
problems I've been having composing async code.

Yup, go blocks return a channel with the last value calculated from
the body:

`Returns a channel which will receive the result of the body when
completed`

Anyways, what don't I like about the block above?

+ Have to remember to close the channel, if you forget it stays open
  forever.
+ Feels ugly. Why? The meat of the post-backend-request code is the
  updating of state, but there's a lot of ceremonoy there: Put value
  on `ch`, wrap in function, provide where to update the data.
+ Mixing place-oriented and other stuff.

For the entire scope of the function we're only updating the target
example.


So I could create a function that closes over some of the repeated
info:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

  (defn handle-update-example [state {:keys [text _id]}]
    (let [ch (chan)
          update-cur-example (fn [state & maps]
                               (update-example
                                 state
                                 _id
                                 #(apply merge % maps)))]
      (put! ch (uef state {:loading? true}))
      (go
        (let [res (<! (req-update-example _id text))]
          (put! ch
            (fn [state]
              (if (:success res)
                (update-cur-example state
                  (:data res)
                  {:loading? false :editing? false})

                (update-cur-example state
                  {:error (:message res)
                   :loading? false})))))
        (close! ch))
      ch))

#+END_SRC

This doesn't really feel like an improvement. Just moving the problem
around. You do save a few lines, but is it more readable?

Next, have a `set-in-example` function that mirrors the clojure.core
assoc / update pairs:


#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

(defn handle-update-example [state {:keys [text _id]}]
  (let [ch (chan)]
    (put! ch (set-in-example state _id {:loading? true}))
    (go
      (let [res (<! (req-update-example _id text))]
        (put! ch
          (fn [state]
            (if (:success res)
              (set-in-example state _id
                (:data res)
                {:loading? false :editing? false})

              (set-in-example state
                {:error (:message res)
                 :loading? false})))))
      (close! ch))
    ch))

#+END_SRC

This does feel more readable, and the `set-in-example` function is
probably useful in multiple contexts. `merge-with-example` is probably
a better name. The tough thing with these functions is that they're
hard-coding the location of examples, but that shouldn't change.

Meh.


* <2016-10-28 Fri 16:58>

2nd problem. I've got a single component -- example editor --that's
used in two different contexts: when the user is creating examples and
when they're editing examples. The final action is to either create or
update, but the component only has one signal (::save). I'm handling
the different cases using top-level logic (create if no _id, update if
_id), but this information is also available to the component. So
these two cases are still hard-coded. Kind of?

Anyway, onto see alsos. I remember the UI I did last time was
wonky, time to fix that.

Ok, so throttle / debounce on the component side or on the logic side?
First hunch was on the logic side, but maybe this is an option that
should be on the component.

On the SA UI, why is there an add button? The add buttons should be on
the AC results (can't add a SA to a var that doesn't exist). Yay!

* <2023-05-09 Tue 21:43>

Might as well pick up where he left off. Since datomic is now open source and
supports most of Clojure's data types, I'm thinking of introducing
it into the fold. Also, reitit looks like a nice alternative to compojure. I like
that it's a little more data oriented.

Finally, I'm thinking of implementing a library crawler TBD...
